[ALTR](https://www.altr.com) provides tag-based data masking, access governance, and classification for Snowflake, Databricks, and OLTP databases. This MCP server enables AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients) to manage data security on the ALTR platform, covering database connections, tag masking, policies, classification, access management, audits, telemetry, and sidecar configuration.

> **New to ALTR?** See the [ALTR documentation](https://docs.altr.com) for an overview of the platform, concepts, and supported data sources.

All tools return structured `{success, data, error}` responses and can run over stdio, SSE, or streamable-http transports.

## Quick Start

1. **Install from PyPI:**

   ```bash
   pip install altr-mcp
   ```

   Or run directly with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) (no install required):

   ```bash
   uvx altr-mcp
   ```

   > `uvx` is part of the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package manager. Install it with `pip install uv` or see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. **Set the three required environment variables** (see [Getting Credentials](#getting-credentials) for where to find each in the ALTR console):

   ```bash
   export ORG_ID=your-org-id
   export MAPI_KEY=your-api-key
   export MAPI_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

3. **Wire it into your AI client** — see [Setup](#setup) for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf. The same three env vars go into the client's `env` block.

4. **Verify** by asking your AI assistant to run a read-only tool:

   - "List my ALTR databases" → calls `get_databases`
   - "Show me the tags connected to ALTR" → calls `get_tags`
   - "List the ALTR roles in my org" → calls `get_roles`

   If these return data, your setup is working.

## Getting Credentials

You need three values from the ALTR platform to configure this server. See [Manage API keys](https://docs.altr.com/account-and-api/api/api-keys/) for the full reference.

| Credential | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `ORG_ID` | In the ALTR console: **Settings > Preferences > Organization** — copy the value from "ALTR Organization ID" |
| `MAPI_KEY` | In the ALTR console: **Settings > Preferences > API > Add New** — give it a description, then copy the key |
| `MAPI_SECRET` | Shown once when you create the API key above — copy and store it securely |

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables before starting the server:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ORG_ID` | Yes | ALTR organization ID |
| `MAPI_KEY` | Yes | ALTR management API key |
| `MAPI_SECRET` | Yes | ALTR management API secret |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | Transport protocol: `stdio` (default), `sse`, or `streamable-http` |
| `MCP_HOST` | No | Bind address for HTTP transports (default: `0.0.0.0`) |
| `MCP_PORT` | No | Port for HTTP transports (default: `8000`) |
| `RESTRICTED_TOOLS` | No | Comma-separated tool names to hide from clients |
| `SUPPORT_MODE` | No | Expose only the 71 read-only tools (default: `false`). See [Support Read-Only Mode](#support-read-only-mode) |
| `SUPPORT_PROMPTS` | No | Publish the troubleshooting prompts over `prompts/list` (default: `false`). See [Troubleshooting Prompts](#troubleshooting-prompts) |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | No | Log output format: `console` (default) or `json` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Log level (default: `INFO`) |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | No | Attempts per API call before giving up (default: `3`, minimum `1`) |
| `DISABLE_RETRY` | No | Set `true` to disable retries entirely (default: `false`) |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | No | Per-request timeout in seconds (default: `30`) |
| `MAX_RETRY_AFTER` | No | Ceiling in seconds on a server-sent `Retry-After` (default: `60`) |

`MAX_RETRIES` counts total attempts, not retries on top of the first, so `1`
disables retrying without disabling the retry path. Backoff is exponential with
jitter; a `Retry-After` response header overrides it, clamped to
`MAX_RETRY_AFTER` so a server cannot park a call indefinitely.

#### Endpoint overrides

Every ALTR service endpoint can be pointed elsewhere, which is useful against
a non-production ALTR environment. All are optional — leave them unset in
normal use.

The seven per-service endpoints are derived from your `ORG_ID` as
`https://<ORG_ID>.<service>.live.altr.com`, four of them with a version path
segment appended. An override replaces the whole value, so it must include that
path segment where the default has one — see the table.

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `ALTR_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.live.altr.com` |
| `ALTR_ALTRNET_BASE_URL` | `https://altrnet.live.altr.com` |
| `ALTR_CLASSIFICATION_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.classification.live.altr.com` |
| `ALTR_SC_CONTROL_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.sc-control.live.altr.com` |
| `ALTR_SERVICE_USER_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.service-user.live.altr.com` |
| `ALTR_AUDIT_REPORT_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.audit-report.live.altr.com/v1` |
| `ALTR_VAULT_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.vault.live.altr.com/api/v2` |
| `ALTR_CRITICAL_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.critical.live.altr.com/v2` |
| `ALTR_KMA_BASE_URL` | `https://<ORG_ID>.kma.live.altr.com/v1` |

### Restricting Tools

Use `RESTRICTED_TOOLS` to hide specific tools from MCP clients. Restricted tools are removed from the tool list and blocked if called directly.

Names must match the registered tool name exactly. An entry that matches nothing restricts nothing, and is logged as a warning the first time a client lists tools. Note that 11 tools were renamed from `delete_*` to `disconnect_*` in 0.4.0.

For example, to give a team read-only access without any destructive operations:

```bash
RESTRICTED_TOOLS=disconnect_database,delete_policy,delete_rule,disconnect_tag,disconnect_tag_by_details,delete_classifier,delete_collection,disconnect_sc_repo,disconnect_sc_sidecar
```

Or in the Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret",
        "RESTRICTED_TOOLS": "disconnect_database,delete_policy,delete_rule,disconnect_tag"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is an operator-level safety net — it prevents accidental or unwanted tool usage but is not a substitute for proper API key permissions.

### Support Read-Only Mode

Set `SUPPORT_MODE=true` to expose only the 71 lookup tools and withhold the 85 that change
anything. Intended for support and field engineering investigations, where the job is to read
configuration and audit history and an accidental write would be a production incident.

On stdio `tools/list` reports 72, the 71 lookups plus an inert `enter_support_mode`, so that a
prompt opening with that call still reads correctly. On the HTTP transports it reports 71.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret",
        "SUPPORT_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Enabling it also appends a set of operating instructions to the server instructions sent to the
client, covering what the remaining tools cannot tell you: that this server reads one
organization only and never the customer's, that an empty result is not proof of absence, and
that audit query text should be treated as customer data.

Available tools are those whose names begin with `get_`, `list_`, or `search_`, with two
deliberate exceptions. The four detokenization tools are withheld even though they are annotated
`readOnlyHint`, because they return real customer values rather than configuration. The three
`search_*` audit tools are included even though they carry no annotation, because they POST a
search request rather than issuing a GET and no audit investigation is possible without them.

`SUPPORT_MODE` composes with `RESTRICTED_TOOLS`; both filters apply. It is a guardrail rather
than a security boundary, since whoever starts the server can also unset it. Note that there is
no key-scoping control underneath it: an ALTR API key inherits the full permissions of the
administrator who created it and cannot be scoped to a subset, and only Super Administrators can
create one. See [docs/support-mode.md](docs/support-mode.md) for the full list and design notes.

#### Without editing any config: `enter_support_mode`

The env var above requires editing a client config and restarting. The operators most in need of
a guardrail are the least likely to do that correctly, so the same enforcement can be armed from
inside a session:

| Tool | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `enter_support_mode` | Arms the allow-list for the rest of the session. No restart, no config change. |
| `request_write_unlock` | Releases exactly one named tool for exactly one call, with a recorded reason, then re-latches. |
| `exit_support_mode` | Restores every tool, given a confirmation phrase the operator types. Returns a log of what changed while the mode was on. |

Tool visibility updates immediately through a `tools/list_changed` notification, so withheld
tools disappear from the client rather than failing when called.

The two paths are deliberately not equally reversible. A mode the operator set through
`SUPPORT_MODE` cannot be unlocked or exited by any tool, and `exit_support_mode` and
`request_write_unlock` are withheld entirely in that mode: a decision made in configuration
should not be reversible by the model it was meant to constrain. Only a mode the session armed
itself can be stood down by the session.

Two limits worth stating plainly. Arming is model-dependent, since something has to call
`enter_support_mode`; once armed, enforcement is identical to the env var, because it is the same
middleware. And the detokenization tools and the two token-delete tools are never unlockable at
any scope, so no unlock, however narrow, returns plaintext.

These tools refuse to run on the `sse` and `streamable-http` transports, where one process can
serve several clients and a per-process latch would restrict all of them. Use `SUPPORT_MODE`
there.

### Troubleshooting Prompts

Set `SUPPORT_PROMPTS=true` to publish eight prompts over `prompts/list`, one per common support
symptom, which then appear in the client's prompt menu:

`altr_masking_not_applying`, `altr_masking_returns_null`,
`altr_classification_job_stuck`, `altr_classification_results_wrong`,
`altr_sidecar_not_connecting`, `altr_sidecar_impersonation_failing`,
`altr_cannot_disconnect_resource`, `altr_who_accessed_data`

They are off by default. A published prompt shows up in every user's prompt menu the moment they
upgrade, so publishing one is a customer-facing change and should be a deliberate decision rather
than something inherited from a version bump.

Setting `SUPPORT_PROMPTS` also appends a short instruction block telling the assistant to arm
support mode before troubleshooting, which covers your own ad-hoc questions and not just these
eight prompts. It is gated with the prompts rather than shipped to everyone, since it steers the
model to withhold writes. Both are published on `stdio` only, because the control tools refuse on
`sse` and `streamable-http`; use `SUPPORT_MODE` there.

Each one begins by instructing the client to call `enter_support_mode`, so picking a prompt is
what arms the guardrail. That call stays available even under `SUPPORT_MODE`, where it is a no-op
reporting the mode is already on, so the prompts read correctly under both paths. Serving them
from the server rather than pasting them from a wiki page means the guardrail line cannot be
dropped in transit and the wording versions with the release.

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings > Developer > Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add altr -e ORG_ID=your-org-id -e MAPI_KEY=your-api-key -e MAPI_SECRET=your-api-secret -- uvx altr-mcp
```

This writes the config to `.mcp.json` which can be committed to share with your team.

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-scoped):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

Open User Settings JSON (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)") and add:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "altr": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["altr-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
          "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
          "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running from Local Source

To run from a local clone instead of the published PyPI package:

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add altr \
  -e ORG_ID=your-org-id \
  -e MAPI_KEY=your-api-key \
  -e MAPI_SECRET=your-api-secret \
  -- uv run --directory /path/to/altr-mcp altr-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altr": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/altr-mcp", "altr-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ORG_ID": "your-org-id",
        "MAPI_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "MAPI_SECRET": "your-api-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## CLI (Optional)

> This section is for building a standalone CLI binary from the MCP server. If you just want to use the server with Claude Desktop or Claude Code, skip to [Tools](#tools).

A standalone CLI lets you call ALTR tools directly from the terminal without an MCP client. It's built with [mcporter](https://github.com/openclaw/mcporter), an open-source tool that compiles MCP servers into native CLI binaries. See the [mcporter docs](https://github.com/openclaw/mcporter) for the full set of options.

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for `npx` to fetch and run `mcporter`)

`mcporter` itself does not need to be installed separately — `npx` downloads and runs it on demand.

### Building

From the repo root:

```bash
npx mcporter generate-cli --command "uv run --directory . altr-mcp" --name altr-cli --compile ./altr-cli
```

This generates a compiled binary at `./altr-cli`.

### Usage

Set your credentials as environment variables, then run any tool:

```bash
export ORG_ID=your-org-id
export MAPI_KEY=your-api-key
export MAPI_SECRET=your-api-secret

# List databases
./altr-cli get-databases

# Get a specific database ID
./altr-cli get-database-id --database-name "my_database"

# Create a masking policy
./altr-cli create-policy --tag "STOPLIGHT"

# Add rules (pass JSON string for complex params)
./altr-cli add-rules --policy-id "TAG#abc123" --rules '[{"masking_policy": 10001, "role": "PUBLIC", "tag_value": "red"}]'

# Search query audits
./altr-cli search-query-audits --limit 10

# JSON output
./altr-cli get-databases --output json

# See all available commands
./altr-cli --help
```

The CLI runs the MCP server locally via `uv run` and requires the repo to be present at the working directory. All environment variables from the [Configuration](#configuration) section apply.

### Critical callouts

A few things are easy to miss and worth surfacing here:

**Snowflake tags vs Databricks tags.** A **Snowflake tag** is a first-class ALTR object — you register it with `connect_tag`, it gets a `tag_group_id`, and shows up in `get_tags`, `get_tag_details*`, `update_tag`, and `disconnect_tag*`. A **Databricks tag** is the opposite: not an ALTR object at all, just a raw string you pass into `create_policy` (with `policy_type="PUSHDOWN"` and `database_ids=[…]`). Databricks tags never appear in `get_tags` and do not have a `tag_group_id`. None of the Tags tools apply to Databricks.

**Databricks `create_policy` requirements.** When creating a masking policy for a Databricks metastore, you **must** pass `database_ids` as a list — even for a single database (e.g. `database_ids=[2167]`) — and set `policy_type="PUSHDOWN"`. Omitting `database_ids` or using `policy_type="TAG"` will be rejected by the API. Snowflake policies do the opposite: omit `database_ids` and let `policy_type` default to `TAG`.

## Data Source Support

**Legend:** ✅ Supported &nbsp; ⚠️ Partial &nbsp; ❌ Not supported &nbsp; — Not applicable

**Classification mode coverage:**

| Mode | Snowflake | OLTP | Databricks |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-house (ALTR pattern matching) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ALTR Native classifiers | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| GDLP (Google Cloud DLP) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Databricks classification — Partial:** GDLP only via `create_databricks_job`; no in-house or ALTR Native classifiers. A `collection_name` may optionally be passed to scope the scan to a specific ALTR collection's classifiers (subject to `condition_types`); when omitted, all default Google DLP infoTypes are used.

**Access management policies (Databricks):** This MCP server does not currently expose Databricks grant or access management APIs. For Databricks access control, use the Databricks UI or REST API directly.

**OLTP** refers to relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server) accessed through a customer-managed [ALTR sidecar proxy](https://docs.altr.com/data-sources/oltp/).

## Troubleshooting

### Checking which version you are running

```bash
uvx altr-mcp --version
```

This works without credentials. Your AI client also reports the same version as the server version when it connects, which is the quickest way to confirm the client actually picked up an upgrade.

### `uvx: command not found`

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): `pip install uv` or via the [official installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Server not appearing in your AI client

Restart your AI client after editing the config file — changes are not picked up automatically.

### `ERROR: Missing required environment variables`

Verify `ORG_ID`, `MAPI_KEY`, and `MAPI_SECRET` are set in the `env` block of your client config. Variable names are case-sensitive.

### Tools returning `{"success": false, ...}`

| HTTP status | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid credentials | Verify `MAPI_KEY` / `MAPI_SECRET` in the ALTR console under **Settings > Preferences > API** |
| `403` | Feature not enabled for this organization | The endpoint exists but is gated by an ALTR feature flag your org doesn't have turned on. Contact ALTR support to confirm the feature is enabled for your account. |
| `404` | Resource not found | Confirm the ID exists in your organization |
| `429` | Rate limited | The server retries automatically up to 3× with backoff; if persistent, reduce request frequency |

### A tool is missing from the tool list

Check whether the tool name appears in the `RESTRICTED_TOOLS` env var in your client config. Restricted tools are hidden from the tool list entirely.

### A restricted tool is still exposed

`RESTRICTED_TOOLS` matches names exactly, so a misspelled or renamed entry restricts nothing. Check the server log for `tool_restriction_middleware.unknown_tools`, which names any entry that matched no registered tool.

### Timeouts on large result sets

Use pagination parameters (`limit`, `offset`, or `cursor`) available on audit, telemetry, and classification tools to reduce response size.
