"""Tool restriction middleware.

Hides and blocks tools listed in RESTRICTED_TOOLS, and, when an
allow-list is in force, every tool absent from it.

The allow-list can be static (passed in at construction, which is what
the SUPPORT_MODE env var does) or live (read from a
SupportModeController, which is what the enter_support_mode tool does).
Enforcement is the same code either way. That matters: the runtime path
is not a softer kind of check, it is the same check reading a value that
can change.
