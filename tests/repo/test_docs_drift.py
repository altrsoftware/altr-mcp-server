"""Guard the documentation against drifting from the live tool registry.

Nothing else in the suite compares prose to code, which is how the 0.4.0
``delete_* -> disconnect_*`` rename shipped green while ``.env.example``
kept advertising names that no longer resolved.

Two classes of drift are covered:

* **Names** — every tool-shaped identifier in the docs must resolve to a
  registered tool.
* **Counts** — every per-domain "(N tools)" heading must match what is
  actually registered. Repo-wide totals are not claimed anywhere and so
  are not checked.

Both derive their expectations from ``register_all``, so a new tool or a
rename fails here until the docs are updated.
